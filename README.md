# Usage

Check swagger for endpoints, parameters and more info

In order to execute swap transaction you need to check if user allowed to spend input tokens amount. If not, use approve endpoint and send approve tx

Example of getting best path from token to token:

`/swap/quote?amount=10&fromTokenAddress=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000&toTokenAddress=0xB31f66AA3C1e785363F0875A1B74E27b85FD66c7`

Quick overview:

## Swap

### Get best path from token to token

`GET /swap/quote?amount=&fromTokenAddress=&toTokenAddress=`

### Get swap transaction for best path

`GET /swap?fromAddress=&amount=&fromTokenAddress=&toTokenAddress=`

## Info
